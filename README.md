BonsAI is Discord bot specializing in haiku responses built on top of a [personal starter repo](https://github.com/radiylon/rad-discord-gpt-starter). Uses an LLMChain rather than calling a model directly.

## Example 🐴
Query:<br>
@BonsAI Is git a good skill to learn?

Response:<br>
_Git is a tool for code,<br>
Version control is its role,<br>
Learn it, you'll feel whole._<br>

_But remember, my friend,<br>
Skills are tools, not the end,<br>
Use them to transcend._<br>
